# PutGVMLToClipboard

This tool, given path to a gvml zip, puts the gvml content on the clip board.

## Motivation

Primary motivation behind the tools was to help debugging gvml for various copy/paste/conversionb scenarios in office apps.
This tool faciliates pasting gvml files on the clipboard which can then be copy/pasted in the office apps to see how the content is rendered/persisted.
This helps investigate issues with gvml -> app xml file conversion.
